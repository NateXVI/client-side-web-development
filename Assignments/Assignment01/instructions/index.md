# Public personal profile

**Due: Jan 28, 2022 at 11:59pm**

In this assignment, you will be creating your public personal profile and publishing it to your personal Icarus page (https://icarus.cs.weber.edu/~your_user_name/ (Links to an external site.). Information about accessing icarus can be found at https://weber.edu/CS/remote-access.html (Links to an external site.).

Your profile must be created inside an HTML file named index.html. It should contain information about yourself, your school-related activities, your projects, your interests, your awards/honors, and/or your hobbies. It should not contain any private or sensitive information that would not want to share with the world. The organization and layout of this profile are left up to you; just make sure it's simple, clean, and professional.

Your profile must make use of the following HTML elements:

Title
Robots and description meta tags in addition to the charset and viewport meta tags
Semantic elements such as header, footer, section, aside, etc.
Paragraphs
Headings
Lists
Images; at least one
Line breaks and horizontal rules
How the page looks like and how these elements are put together are left up to you. Your CSS rules must be placed inside an external .css file named styles.css and linked to your .html file(s).

NOTE: Use actual text; no LOREM IPSUM in this page.

When done, use an SFTP client to transfer your files into your icarus account, test your profile in the browser (at least using Chrome and Firefox), and submit its URL via Canvas.
