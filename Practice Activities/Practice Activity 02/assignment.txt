A weblog or simply a blog is a web site for an informal diary or journal where people (called bloggers) write about their opinions, thoughts, and/or experiences. An article in a blog is called a blog post. 

Design a template HTML page for a typical blog post with the following components at a minimum:

Title
Author
Publication date
An image (Link to an open source image from https://unsplash.com (Links to an external site.))
Multiple sections each with a heading and multiple paragraphs. Use Lorem Ipsum (Links to an external site.) to generate dummy text for your post.
The page must also:

include a robots and a description meta tags
contain clean well-indented HTML
make use of the following HTML elements:
Semantic elements such as header, nav, main, aside, footer, article, section
Different levels of headings (h1, h2, ...)
Paragraphs.
At least three lists: one for each type (unordered, ordered, and definition lists)
Line breaks and horizontal rules
use multiple colors
have all the CSS rules inside a <style></style> element under the document <head></head>
Validate your page at https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_upload (Links to an external site.) and make sure it contains no warnings or errors. Submit your HTML file via Canvas.
